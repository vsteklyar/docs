# Installation Workflow

1. You start with the Aiphoria Platform CLI on your local machine. It connects to Aiphoria Cloud, checks your access through the Delivery Service, and downloads the official components from the Aiphoria Components Registry.
2. If you’re developing your own components, they’re built through your CI/CD pipeline and published to your Customer Components Registry using the Custom Components Publisher.
3. From there, components - both official and custom—are deployed to your development, staging, and production environments as Aiphoria Instances.
4. These instances can then connect to your existing tools and systems through the Customer Integrations layer.

# Before you begin

Make sure the following requirements are met:

- Your infrastructure complies with all prerequisites outlined in the Aiphoria Platform license agreement.
- You have a valid verification key to access the Aiphoria Delivery Service.
- You have the necessary access and permissions to deploy the platform in the target environments.
